# AI-Based and Hybrid Weather Models

This page indexes all weather models in this repository that use machine learning or artificial intelligence as a core part of the forecast process.

AI-based weather models have rapidly moved from research into operational use. This index groups them together to make discovery easier, since they are otherwise distributed across the repository by operator and model type (global/regional, deterministic/ensemble).

## How AI is being used in operational NWP

Different meteorological centres are integrating AI into weather prediction in different ways. Four patterns have emerged:

1. **Standalone AI forecast models.** A trained neural network replaces the physics-based forecast integration entirely. The model starts from a physics-derived analysis (initial conditions) and rolls forward autoregressively using learned dynamics. *Examples: AIFS Single, AIGFS, GEML.*

2. **AI-based ensembles.** Same as above, but trained probabilistically to produce ensemble members, usually by injecting random noise during inference. *Examples: AIFS ENS, AIGEFS.*

3. **Hybrid physics–AI systems.** The physics-based model continues to run the forecast, but AI predictions guide or constrain parts of it — typically through spectral nudging toward AI-generated large-scale fields. *Examples: GDPS (ECCC, operational since v10.0.0 — physics forecast nudged toward the GEML AI model).*

4. **Grand ensembles combining physics and AI members.** Members from a physics-based ensemble and an AI-based ensemble are combined into a single larger ensemble for probabilistic guidance. *Examples: HGEFS.*

These approaches reflect genuinely different theories about how AI should enter operational forecasting. The physics-based NWP community has not converged on a single answer, and this repository documents multiple approaches side by side.

- **Approach:** Grand ensemble combining 31 GEFS (physics) members with 31 AIGEFS (AI) members

## Experimental AI productionizations

The following systems are productionizations of research AI architectures that are run experimentally by NWP centres but have not (or have not yet) become operational forecast products.

## Models consuming AI-based inputs

Some operational models do not themselves use AI but incorporate AI-model outputs as inputs to their blending or post-processing logic.

### [NBM v5.0 (NOAA)](./models/nwp_models/regional/usa/nbm.md)
As of NBM v5.0 (operational May 5, 2026), the National Blend of Models incorporates two AI-based global models as inputs — **ECAIFS** (ECMWF's AI/IFS hybrid) and **AIGFS** (NOAA's operational GraphCast-lineage model) — for temperature, wind speed, and QPF products. Both are ingested as deterministic inputs. NBM's input set evolves version-to-version, so the AI-input mix is expected to grow as further AI systems go operational (see [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) and the [NBM entry](./models/nwp_models/regional/usa/nbm.md) for the full input list and planned changes).

## Architectural lineages

Most operational AI weather models trace back to a small number of research architectures. This section maps the relationships:

### GraphCast lineage (Google DeepMind, 2023)
The GraphCast research architecture has been productionized by both NOAA and ECCC, with each centre fine-tuning it on different reanalysis and analysis data:

- **GraphCast** (research) → **GraphCastGFS** (NOAA experimental) → **[AIGFS](./models/nwp_models/global/usa/aigfs.md)** (NOAA operational)
- **GraphCast** (research) → **[GEML](./models/nwp_models/global/canada/gdps-geml.md)** (ECCC experimental)

The two operational lineages share architecture and a 13-pressure-level vertical structure but differ in training data, fine-tuning procedures, and operational status.

### FourCastNet lineage (NVIDIA, 2022)
- **FourCastNet** (research) → **FourCastNetGFS** (NOAA experimental, no operational descendant announced)

### ECMWF in-house architecture
- **[AIFS Single](./models/nwp_models/global/eu/aifs-single.md)** and **[AIFS ENS](./models/ensemble_models/global/eu/aifs-ens.md)** use ECMWF's own encoder–processor–decoder architecture with attention-based GNN encoder/decoder and sliding-window transformer processor. Not derived from GraphCast or FourCastNet.
- **[AICON-Global](./models/nwp_models/global/germany/aicon-global.md)** (DWD) shares the Anemoi encoder–processor–decoder framework with AIFS, applied to ICON's icosahedral mesh and model-level vertical structure rather than ECMWF's lat–lon / pressure-level setup.

## What this page does not cover

- Research-only AI models with no public data (e.g., Pangu-Weather in its original research form) unless they have been productionized by an NWP centre.
- AI post-processing and statistical correction systems that operate downstream of physics-based forecasts without participating in the forecast integration itself.
- Climate reanalysis ML applications.

## Further reading

For background on the transition from physics-based to AI and hybrid NWP, ECMWF Newsletters 181 (AIFS ensembles) and 185 (AIFS ENS operational, IFS Cycle 50r1) are useful starting points. For the Canadian hybrid approach, Husain et al. (2024) on AI-based spectral nudging via arXiv (arXiv:2407.06100) is the primary reference. For NOAA's direction, the NOAA press release on AI-driven global weather models (December 2025) covers AIGFS, AIGEFS, and HGEFS in one place.
