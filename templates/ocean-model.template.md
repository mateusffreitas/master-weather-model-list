# [Model Name] ([System Name or Acronym])

## What this model is
[1–3 paragraphs describing what the model is, what makes it distinct, and what its operational role is. State up front whether it is global or regional, deterministic or ensemble, physics-based or AI-based, and what its primary use case is — standalone forecasts, boundary conditions for downstream regional systems, both, etc. If the system has a commonly-used short name (e.g., GLO12, RTOFS), introduce it here.]

[If the product has a formal Copernicus Marine product identifier, NOAA designation, or similar, state it explicitly here. If the system has multiple naming conventions in active use across documentation, list them.]

---

## Who runs it
- **Production Unit:** [Operating institute]
- **Country:** [Country or "Intergovernmental"]
- **Programme or coordinating body:** [e.g., Copernicus Marine MFC, NOAA NCEP, US Navy FNMOC, BLUElink]
- **Role in any larger system:** [If the model serves as boundary conditions for downstream regional models, or is part of a coupled prediction system, note it here]

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** [Global, regional name, or basin-specific]
- **Domain bounds:** [Lat/lon bounds, or "global"]
- **Grid dimensions:** [If known]
- **Special masked or excluded regions:** [e.g., specific seas masked, ice-covered regions handled separately]

- **Update frequency:** [Daily, twice daily, etc.]
- **Production cycles:** [Cycle times in UTC]

---

## Forcing
- **Atmospheric forcing:** [Source model, resolution, frequency — e.g., ECMWF IFS at 0.1°, 3-hourly]
- **River runoff:** [Climatology, dynamic, or none]
- **Lateral boundary conditions:** [For regional models — parent global system, frequency]
- **Tidal forcing:** [If applicable — explicit tides, parameterized, or none]
- **Ice forcing or coupling:** [If applicable]
- **Initial conditions:** [How the model is initialized at each cycle]

---

## Coupling
[Describe what the model is coupled to and the nature of the coupling. Common cases:]
- **Standalone ocean physics:** No coupling; receives atmospheric forcing as one-way fluxes.
- **One-way coupled to waves:** Receives Stokes drift / wave-modified stress as one-way input.
- **Two-way coupled to waves:** Bidirectional exchange via OASIS3-MCT or similar coupler.
- **Coupled to sea ice:** Online or offline; describe coupling frequency.
- **Coupled to atmosphere:** For seamless prediction systems.

[For each coupled component, list: which fields are exchanged, in which directions, at what frequency, via which coupler.]

---

## Data assimilation
- **DA scheme:** [3DVar, 4DVar, EnKF, SEEK filter, OI, hybrid, none]
- **Update cycle:** [Frequency and window length]
- **Increment application:** [IAU, direct, FGAT, etc.]

### Assimilated observations
- **Sea surface height (altimetry):** [Missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A/B, Sentinel-6A, CryoSat-2, SWOT, HY-2B, etc.]
- **Sea surface temperature:** [Sources: AVHRR, VIIRS, AMSR2, in-situ blends like OSTIA or NOAA OISST]
- **In-situ temperature and salinity profiles:** [Argo, XBT, CTD, gliders, moored arrays]
- **Sea ice concentration:** [Source — e.g., OSI SAF, NSIDC]
- **Sea ice thickness:** [If applicable — CryoSat-2, SMOS]
- **Sea surface salinity:** [If applicable — SMOS, SMAP, Aquarius]
- **Other:** [HF radar surface currents, drifters, etc.]

[Note: Some operational ocean systems use a frozen analysis from a partner organization rather than running their own DA — for example, RTOFS historically used NAVOCEANO's analysis. Document this explicitly if applicable.]

## Relationship to other ocean products

### Companion products from same operator
[List sister products from the same Production Unit — e.g., a wave product, biogeochemistry product, regional downscaling, or reanalysis counterpart. Cross-link to existing repository entries.]

### Peer global ocean physics systems
[For global systems, list peer operational systems with similar capability. Examples: GLO12 ↔ Global RTOFS ↔ Navy Global HYCOM ↔ BLUElink OceanMAPS. For regional systems, list global parents and overlapping regional systems.]

### Regional models nested inside this system
[If this is a global system that provides boundary conditions for regional downscalings, list them. If this is a regional system, identify its parent global product.]

### AI-based counterparts
[If applicable — many physics-based ocean systems now have neural-network counterparts trained on their reanalyses (e.g., GLONET trained on GLORYS12). Cross-reference. When adding a new AI-based system, also update [`AI_MODELS.md`](../AI_MODELS.md).]
