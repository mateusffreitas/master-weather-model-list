# Templates

These templates are here to make adding new model entries fast and consistent.

The available templates are:
- [`nwp-model.template.md`](./nwp-model.template.md) — deterministic numerical weather prediction models (global and regional)
- [`ensemble-model.template.md`](./ensemble-model.template.md) — ensemble forecast systems (global and regional)
- [`wave-model.template.md`](./wave-model.template.md) — ocean wave forecast models
- [`ocean-model.template.md`](./ocean-model.template.md) — ocean physics forecast models (temperature, salinity, currents, sea level, sea ice)
- [`tropical-cyclone-model.template.md`](./tropical-cyclone-model.template.md) — tropical cyclone / hurricane forecast models
- [`air-quality-model.template.md`](./air-quality-model.template.md) — air quality and atmospheric composition models
- [`nowcasting-model.template.md`](./nowcasting-model.template.md) — nowcasting systems (observation extrapolation, seamless extrapolation–NWP blends, and ML-based 0–6 h prediction)

How to use:
1. Copy the template that best fits the model category.
2. Rename the file to the model name (e.g. `gfs.md`, `gefs.md`, `ukmo-wave.md`).
3. Place the file in the appropriate directory under `models/` (by type, geographic scope, and country or organization).
4. Fill in all fields you can verify from official documentation.
5. If a field is unknown, leave `TBD` (do not guess).
6. Prefer official docs for: resolution, vertical levels, run frequency, forecast length, and download format.

Tips:
- If the model is part of a family (e.g., ICON vs ICON-EPS, IFS vs EPS), add a short note in **Notes**.
- If there are multiple domains (e.g., several coastal wave domains), make separate entries unless the operator treats them as a single product.
- If the public data is a subset of the full operational model, mention that under **Notes**.
- If the model is being retired, upgraded, or has version-specific details worth tracking, consider adding a **Version history** or **Status** section as seen in existing entries like `nbm.md`, `rrfs.md`, and `raqdps.md`.
- For AI-based or hybrid systems, the NWP or ensemble template is usually the right starting point — note the AI approach in the **What this model is** section and update the repository's [`AI_MODELS.md`](../AI_MODELS.md) index when adding a new one.
