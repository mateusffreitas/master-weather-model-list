## Notes
- <Anything important: scope of public data vs full operational, unusual update timing, quirks of domain coverage, known biases or limitations.>
- <Note whether the model is part of a broader system or programme (e.g., coupled with a specific NWP suite, a component of a national air quality programme like NAQFC, or a member of a multi-model ensemble like CAMS Regional).>
- <Mention any seasonal or episodic variation in product availability, such as wildfire-only runs.>
- <For AI-based or hybrid composition systems, note the AI approach here and update [`AI_MODELS.md`](../AI_MODELS.md).>

---

## Recent version history (optional)
<Include this section if the model has documented operational upgrades worth tracking — air quality systems change driving NWP model, emissions inventories, and chemistry versions often enough that this is frequently warranted. See `raqdps.md` and `aqm.md` for examples. Otherwise omit.>
