# ALADIN-HR (Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service)

## What this model is
ALADIN-HR is the **regional limited-area deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) system** operated by the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service (DHMZ).

It is part of the **ALADIN limited-area model system** (developed within the ALADIN consortium and the **RC LACE** regional cooperation, now under the **ACCORD** umbrella) and is used operationally for short-range weather forecasting over Croatia and the Adriatic region. The system is the basis for DHMZ's national warning service, civil-protection and wildfire-prevention products, and a range of specialized partner products (aviation, marine, road and rail traffic, energy, agriculture, water management, nautical tourism).

- **Vertical levels:** 73
- **Forecast length:** Up to **72 hours** (hourly fields)

- **Temporal output resolution:** Hourly (selected fields)

---

## Data assimilation
- **Data assimilation:** Yes
- **Method / cadence:**
  - **Atmosphere:** **3-hourly 3D-Var** with a **static EDA** B-matrix; **Jk** (large-scale information constraint) and **SCC** (space-consistent coupling) used in the assimilation/initialization
  - **Surface:** **Optimal Interpolation (OI)** via CANARI; CANARI tuning (EXP10 settings + external 9-hour Wp smoothing, "v7.9") was put operational on **22 April 2024** to correct unrealistic annual soil-moisture evolution and forecast jumpiness during summer
- **Assimilation cycle:** 3 h
- **Observation cut-off time:** 1 h 40 min
- **Coupling:** IFS, 1-hourly (lagged in operational cycling)
- **Observations assimilated** (per the 2024 RC LACE DA status report):
  - **Surface:** SYNOP
  - **Aircraft:** AMDAR, **Mode-S MRAR** (CHMI & SI streams)
  - **Atmospheric motion vectors:** GEOWIND
  - **Radiosondes:** TEMP
  - **Satellite radiances:** MSG SEVIRI
  - **Radar:** **OPERA radar reflectivity** — implemented operationally from the end of 2023; data from the **NIMBUS** production line (comparable performance to ODYSSEY); a combined rain-threshold + observation-error-inflation method (offset 0.35, threshold 0.0; "exp2_3") was selected for operational use, and improves 1 h rain rates at Croatian automatic stations with neutral verification scores against the no-radar-DA baseline. Thinning distance in the bator namelist was increased after operational implementation to handle memory issues in screening for spatially widely distributed precipitation patterns.

## Initial and boundary conditions
- **Initial conditions:** Local 3D-Var + CANARI analysis on the ALADIN-HR domain

- National weather forecasting and warnings
- Civil protection, rescue, and wildfire-prevention products
- Aviation, maritime, road and rail traffic safety
- Energy (renewable production estimation, grid management, gas transport)
- Agriculture, water management, biometeorology
- Nautical tourism and sailing
- Outdoor event planning and structural wind-load assessment

## Publicly available products

> The two endpoints below are **not advertised on the DHMZ public website**. They were provided directly by DHMZ on request, after the maintainer of this repository contacted them about including DHMZ in a list of free and public weather models. Anyone wanting to use this data is encouraged to contact DHMZ directly (dhmz@dhz.hr) and ask whether they're happy for it to be used for their intended purpose; licensing terms are not stated on the endpoints themselves. The credentials below are the ones DHMZ provided.

## Recent version history

### 22 April 2024 — Operational CANARI tuning
New CANARI surface-analysis settings (EXP10 + external 9-hour Wp smoothing, internally referred to as "v7.9") were put operational, correcting two previously identified problems linked to surface DA: forecast "jumpiness" during summer and unrealistic annual soil-moisture evolution. The change improves T2m and RH2m verification in both winter and summer periods and the representation of fog / low-cloud cases.

### End of 2023 — OPERA radar reflectivity assimilated operationally
Radar reflectivities from OPERA were successfully implemented in the ALADIN-HR operational chain. Data is sourced from the **NIMBUS** production line, which showed comparable performance to the older ODYSSEY line. A combined rain-threshold and observation-error-inflation method (offset 0.35, threshold 0.0) was selected for operational use after tuning to reduce the "drying" effect in the Bayesian inversion of reflectivity data. Verification showed improved 1 h rain rates at Croatian automatic stations and neutral surface / upper-air scores against the no-radar-DA baseline. Thinning distance in the bator namelist was subsequently increased to address memory issues in screening for spatially widely distributed precipitation patterns.

### February 2023 — DA suite operational on new HPC
The ALADIN-HR data-assimilation suite became operational on the new DHMZ HPC system (Neverin) running model cycle **cy43t2_bf10** on a 480 × 432 / 4.0 km / L73 domain, with a 3-hourly 3D-Var + OI cycle, static EDA B-matrix, Jk + SCC, IFS 1-hourly coupling (lagged), 1 h 40 min observation cut-off, and the observation set listed above (SYNOP, AMDAR, Mode-S MRAR CHMI & SI, GEOWIND, TEMP, SEVIRI, OPERA/OIFS reflectivity).

### 2018 (DAWD status) — pre-cy43 ALARO assimilation suite at DHMZ
Earlier ALADIN-HR4 configuration documented at the 2018 LACE DA Working Days used **ALARO-0 / cy38t1** at 4 km / L73 with 3-hourly 3D-Var (NMC B; tests with EDA B), VarBC, REDNMC=1.4, OI surface analysis with MESCAN correlation function, and assimilation of SYNOP (Ps), TEMP (T, q, u, v), AMDAR (T, u, v), AMV, SEVIRI (ch 2, 3) and Mode-S MRAR SI. LBCs from ECMWF (lagged), DFI initialization. Plans at that time included continuing EDA tests, radar DA work, GNSS ZTD tests, Jk testing, and migration to the cy43-series — all of which have since been realized in the current operational suite.

### 2013 (textbook description) — early ALADIN-HR operational suite
The earlier operational chain documented in Tudor et al. (2013) ran ALADIN at 8 km / L37 over a wider Lambert domain, with a 2 km / L15 hydrostatic high-resolution dynamical adaptation (HRDA) for 10 m wind, 72 h forecasts from 00 and 12 UTC ARPEGE-coupled runs, DFI initialization, and a parallel 3D-Var assimilation suite at 4 km / L37 (NMC B) with OI surface analysis. The current 4 km / L73 / cy43t2 / IFS-coupled / radar-DA configuration represents the operational descendant of that system, run on substantially upgraded HPC.
