# WRF Hungary

## What this model is
WRF Hungary is a **convection-permitting regional deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** run by HungaroMet (Hungarian Meteorological Service / OMSZ) over the Carpathian Basin at 1.5 km resolution. HungaroMet runs it four times a day within the framework of its **nowcasting project**, producing short-range (0–36 h) hourly forecast fields oriented toward high-impact and convective weather — the public parameter set includes derived maximum radar reflectivity, wind gusts, cloud layers, and grid-scale precipitation.

Despite being operated under the "nowcasting project" umbrella, WRF is a full NWP model rather than a nowcasting system in the technical sense (it is not an observation-extrapolation or sub-hourly blending product). HungaroMet's dedicated analysis/nowcasting system is **MEANDER**, listed separately on the HungaroMet model menu. WRF is therefore catalogued here as a regional NWP sibling to [AROME Hungary](./arome-hungary.md), with which it shares the HungaroMet open data portal and the same convection-permitting short-range role. *(Placement note for review — see Notes.)*

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic NWP (convection-permitting)
- **Model system / core:** WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting). The dataset description does not specify the dynamical core; WRF-ARW is the near-universal operational/research core, but this is **not explicitly documented** for the HungaroMet configuration (TBD)
- **Code version:** TBD (not stated; the dataset description notes only that "the WRF system is updated once a year")
- **Convection-allowing:** Yes (1.5 km grid; deep convection explicitly resolved)
- **Horizontal resolution:** **1.5 km** (regular lat–lon grid; dx 0.021236° / dy 0.01428°)
- **Vertical levels:** TBD (not stated in the dataset description)
- **Model top:** TBD
- **Forecast length:** **0 – 36 hours**
- **Update frequency:** **4× daily (00/06/12/18 UTC)**
- **Temporal output resolution:** 1 hour

## Data assimilation
- **Data assimilation:** Not documented. The public dataset description does not state whether the HungaroMet WRF runs its own analysis (e.g. WRFDA) or operates purely as downscaling from a driving model (TBD).

---

## Initial and boundary conditions
- **Initial conditions:** TBD (not documented)
- **Lateral boundary conditions:** TBD — the driving global/host model is not stated in the dataset description (TBD)

## Notes
- **Taxonomy / placement (for review):** The dataset description says WRF "runs four times a day within the framework of the nowcasting project of the Hungarian Meteorological Service." Despite the "nowcasting" wording, the system is a deterministic NWP model (0–36 h range, 4×/day cycling, hourly output) rather than a nowcasting system under the repository's definition (observation extrapolation / sub-hourly blend, ~0–6 h). HungaroMet's actual nowcasting/analysis product is **MEANDER**, listed separately. Catalogued here under regional NWP accordingly — flagging in case you'd prefer a cross-reference from the nowcasting category.
- **Sibling models at HungaroMet:** WRF is one of HungaroMet's publicly distributed forecast models alongside [AROME Hungary](./arome-hungary.md) (2.5 km AROME) and the [CHIMERE Hungary](../../../air_quality_models/regional/hungary/chimere-hungary.md) air-quality forecast. The HungaroMet map-model menu also lists ECMWF, AROME, WRF, and MEANDER. Of HungaroMet's in-house NWP, both AROME and WRF are openly distributed on ODP (ALADIN/HU and AROME-EPS are not).
- **Convective orientation:** The public field set is geared toward short-range/convective applications — derived maximum radar reflectivity (`maxLogz`), wind gusts, layered cloud cover, and grid-scale precipitation — consistent with the nowcasting-project context.
- **Largely undocumented configuration:** The dynamical core (ARW assumed but unstated), code version, vertical levels, model top, cycle hours, data assimilation, and driving/host model are **not documented** in the only public description available. Several fields above are TBD pending a more detailed HungaroMet source.

## Revision history
- The dataset description states the **WRF system is updated once a year**. No version labels or dated upgrade history are published in the source on file.
