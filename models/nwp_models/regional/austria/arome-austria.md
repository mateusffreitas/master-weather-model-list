# AROME Austria

## What this model is
AROME Austria (operationally referred to as **AROME-Aut**) is the operational convection-permitting regional deterministic numerical weather prediction model run by GeoSphere Austria over Austria and the surrounding Alpine region.

It is designed for short-range forecasting of small-scale and rapidly evolving weather such as thunderstorms, heavy precipitation, fog, foehn and other local wind effects, with particular strength in mountainous terrain. AROME-Aut is the deterministic member of GeoSphere Austria's broader AROME-based suite, which also includes the regional ensemble system **C-LAEF** (Convection-permitting Limited-Area Ensemble Forecasting) and the higher-resolution rapid-update system **AROME-RUC**.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** GeoSphere Austria (formerly ZAMG — Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik; merged into GeoSphere Austria in 2023)
- **Country / region:** Austria

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Austria and surrounding Alpine regions
- **Domain details:** 600 × 432 grid points centred on the Alpine region; same domain as the operational C-LAEF ensemble

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic NWP (convection-permitting)
- **Model system / core:** AROME (ALADIN-NH non-hydrostatic spectral dynamical core), code cycle **cy43t2bf11**
- **Dynamical formulation:** Non-hydrostatic, spectral, with semi-Lagrangian advection and semi-implicit time integration
- **Convection-allowing:** Yes (deep convection explicitly resolved at 2.5 km; shallow convection parameterized)
- **Horizontal resolution:** ~2.5 km
- **Grid dimensions:** 600 × 432 grid points
- **Vertical levels:** 90 (lowest level ~5 m above ground; model top ~35 km)
- **Forecast length:** 60 hours
- **Update frequency:** 8× daily (00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, 21 UTC)
- **Time step:** 60 s
- **Temporal output resolution:** 1 hour (both 2D and 3D fields)
- **Surface scheme:** SURFEX 8.0
- **Orography / physiography:** GMTED2010 / ECOCLIMAP 1

---

## Data assimilation
- **Data assimilation:** Yes
- **Method / cadence:** **3D-Var** for upper-air, **optimal interpolation (OI)** for surface; cycled every 3 hours with a ±90 minute assimilation window
- **Background-error covariance:** C-LAEF EDA climatological B-matrix (shared with the C-LAEF ensemble)
- **Observations assimilated:** Conventional surface (SYNOP, SHIP, TAWES), aircraft (Mode-S, AMDAR), radiosonde (BUFR TEMP), atmospheric motion vectors (SEVIRI-HR / GeoWind), ceilometer cloud cover (converted to RH; introduced operationally in the September 2023 C-LAEF upgrade), and ASCAT scatterometer winds. The assimilation system is shared in setup with the C-LAEF control run. *(Note: satellite radiances, weather radar, GNSS-ZTD, GNSS-RO and wind-profiler data are assimilated by the higher-resolution AROME-RUC system, not by AROME-Aut/C-LAEF.)*

## Initial and boundary conditions
- **Initial conditions:** 3D-Var (upper-air) + OI (surface)

Deterministic forecasts of:

## Notes
- **Current framing (2026):** As of the 6th ACCORD ASW (April 2026), GeoSphere describes its operational AROME suite as two configurations — C-LAEF (the 2.5 km / L90 16+1 ensemble on ECMWF ATOS, with its control run mirrored on GeoSphere's local HPC) and the 1.2 km AROME-RUC nowcasting system. The deterministic "AROME-Aut" run is this mirrored C-LAEF control; the standalone "AROME-Aut" label is no longer used separately in the most recent documentation, though the configuration is unchanged (cy43t2bf11+).
- AROME-Aut and the **C-LAEF control run** are configured identically but run on different HPC platforms, so the C-LAEF control can act as an operational backup for AROME-Aut. C-LAEF is the 16+1-member regional ensemble companion (same 2.5 km / L90 setup), running on the ECMWF ATOS HPC system. **AROME-RUC** is a separate higher-resolution (1.2 km) rapid-update configuration covering Austria with hourly cycling.
- Hardware: AROME-Aut and AROME-RUC run on GeoSphere Austria's **HPE CRAY-XD2000** cluster (100 nodes, AMD Genoa, Slingshot 11 interconnect, Lustre 200 TB), operational for all NWP systems since **15 January 2025**. The previous HPE Apollo 8600 system was retired at that point. The C-LAEF control run continues to operate on the ECMWF ATOS XH2000.
- Organizational note: GeoSphere Austria was formed by the 2023 merger of ZAMG with the Geological Survey of Austria; older publications and documentation refer to ZAMG.
- A high-resolution Austrian regional reanalysis ensemble (**ARA**), built on the C-LAEF system at 2.5 km / L90 with 10+1 members and 3-hourly cycling, has been developed at GeoSphere Austria targeting the period 2013–2023, with ERA5 providing coupling fields. ARA is a research/reanalysis product distinct from this operational forecast entry.
- **Relationship to the wider AROME family:** AROME-Aut shares the same dynamical core and physics packages as the broader AROME / HARMONIE-AROME family operated by ACCORD-consortium services. See [AROME France](../france/arome-france.md), [AROME-Arctic](../norway/arome-arctic.md), [HARMONIE-AROME Ireland](../ireland/harmonie-arome-ireland.md), and [MEPS](../norway/meps.md) for closely related deployments.

## Recent version history

### Forward look — C-LAEF AlpeAdria (1 km, successor to "C-LAEF 1k")
The "C-LAEF 1k" development has matured into **C-LAEF AlpeAdria**, a 1 km ensemble developed jointly with ARSO (Slovenia) and DHMZ (Croatia), expected to replace operational C-LAEF — and thus the configuration mirrored as the AROME-Aut deterministic control — during summer 2026. It runs on ECMWF ATOS in lagged mode with quadratic spectral truncation, uses newer cycles (cy46t1+ / cy48t3bf3 for the EnVar member), and includes a 3D-EnVar member supporting direct reflectivity assimilation (extending the control variable to hydrometeors rather than the 1D+3D-Var Bayesian approach).

### 2025-01-15 — Migration to new HPC
All GeoSphere Austria operational NWP systems (AROME-Aut, AROME-RUC, and other on-site components) migrated to the new **HPE CRAY-XD2000** cluster. AROME-Aut continues to run with the cy43t2bf11 setup; the migration was a hardware change rather than a model upgrade.

### 2023 (September) — Shared assimilation upgrades with C-LAEF
The September 2023 C-LAEF upgrade introduced changes that AROME-Aut shares through its common assimilation framework, most notably the assimilation of **ceilometer-derived cloud cover** (converted to relative humidity), which improves low-stratus forecasts in autumn and winter. The same upgrade replaced the hybrid model-physics perturbation scheme in C-LAEF with a pure stochastic parameter perturbation (SPP) scheme — this change applies to the ensemble and not to the deterministic AROME-Aut.

### December 2021 — Major upgrade to cycle cy43t2
A major upgrade migrated AROME-Aut (together with C-LAEF and AROME-RUC) from cy40t1 to cy43t2. Beyond the cycle change, the AROME-Aut deterministic configuration received:
- Adapted screening-level diagnostics (for the `LCANOPY=.T.` case) to improve 2 m temperature and relative-humidity performance in the Alpine region
- A modified 3D-Var setup (new B-matrix, REDNMC tuning)
- A switch of orography input from GTOPO30 to GMTED2010
- Additional forecast parameters: precipitation type, updraft helicity, and a weather-symbol code

Prior to this upgrade, AROME-Aut ran cy40t1 with CANARI/OI + 3D-Var assimilation on the HPE Apollo 8600. (The GTOPO30 → GMTED2010 switch here is the origin of the orography setting recorded above.)
