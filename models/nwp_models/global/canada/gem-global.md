# GDPS (Global Deterministic Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) is Canada's primary global numerical weather prediction system, providing deterministic forecasts of atmospheric conditions worldwide.

GDPS is based on the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model and operates as a coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea ice prediction system, supplying large-scale guidance and boundary conditions for Canada's regional and high-resolution forecast systems.

As of version 10.0.0 (operational May 26, 2026), GDPS is a **hybrid physics–AI system**: GEM's large-scale temperature and horizontal wind fields are spectrally nudged toward the [GEML](./gdps-geml.md) data-driven AI weather model during the forecast integration. This hybrid configuration — previously distributed as the experimental GDPS — is now the operational system.

---

## What it provides
Deterministic global forecasts of:
- Atmospheric temperature, wind (3D), humidity, geopotential, and surface pressure
- Quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF), precipitation rate and type
- Cloud condensate, cloud cover, boundary layer height
- Prognostic ozone (LINOZ), total column ozone, and clear-sky / all-sky UV indices
- Sea surface conditions (SST, sea ice concentration and thickness) from the coupled ice-ocean component
- Initial and boundary conditions for downstream Canadian systems

GDPS provides the large-scale deterministic guidance that underpins Canada's regional (RDPS) and high-resolution (HRDPS) deterministic prediction systems, and serves as the meteorological driver for systems such as [RAQDPS](../../../air_quality_models/regional/canada/raqdps.md).

## Hybrid AI-physics forecasting
Since v10.0.0, GEM's large-scale fields are spectrally nudged toward forecasts from [GEML](./gdps-geml.md) v1.1, ECCC's GraphCast-derived graph neural network AI weather model. The design is deliberately conservative — AI guidance is confined to the large scales and mid-troposphere where data-driven models have demonstrated skill, while GEM physics governs smaller scales, the boundary layer, and the stratosphere:
- **Nudged fields:** Large-scale temperature and horizontal wind components (u, v).
- **Vertical profile:** Applied between ~250–850 hPa; no nudging in the planetary boundary layer (>850 hPa) or stratosphere (<250 hPa).
- **Horizontal scales:** A discrete cosine transform (DCT) spectral filter is applied to the Yin and Yang grids separately — full nudging weight for scales >2750 km, ramping to zero below 2250 km.
- **Temporal handling:** GEML output is available every 6 hours; at each 450 s GEM time step the target is linearly interpolated between successive GEML forecasts, with a time-varying nudging weight that peaks when GEML output is available and decays in between (relaxation time 3.28125 h).

See [GEML](./gdps-geml.md) for details of the AI model itself. (Husain et al., 2024)

## Notes
- GDPS uses a global **Yin–Yang grid**, a distinctive feature of modern GEM configurations.
- Background-error covariances in 4DEnVar come entirely from the 256-member LETKF ensemble of GEPS 8.0.0 backgrounds (no NMC component), with scale-dependent horizontal localization.
- GDPS is part of a tightly integrated suite of Canadian operational prediction systems sharing the GEM core, the GEPS ensemble for DA covariances, and GIOPS for ice-ocean initialization.
- Open data licensing is genuinely open — no registration required, direct file access via the Datamart. Same as GIOPS, RIOPS, and CIOPS.

## Recent version history

### GDPS v10.0.0 — operational May 26, 2026 (current)
Implemented at the 12 UTC run on May 26, 2026, replacing v9.1.0. The headline change is the introduction of **hybrid AI-physics forecasting**: the configuration previously distributed as the experimental GDPS is now operational.

Headline changes:
- **Hybrid AI-physics forecasting via spectral nudging.** GEM's large-scale temperature and horizontal wind (u, v) fields between 250–850 hPa are spectrally nudged toward forecasts from **[GEML](./gdps-geml.md) v1.1**, ECCC's graph neural network AI weather model. A DCT-based spectral filter fully constrains scales >2750 km (ramping to zero below 2250 km); the GEML target is refreshed every 6 hours and interpolated in time at each model step (relaxation time 3.28125 h). See *Hybrid AI-physics forecasting* above. (Husain et al., 2024)
- All other components remain aligned with the v9.1.0 / v9.0.0 operational framework (4DEnVar data assimilation, GEM 5.2 dynamics, NEMO 3.6 / CICE 6.2.0 ice-ocean coupling).

## Related: AI component

The hybrid forecasting introduced in v10.0.0 relies on [GEML](./gdps-geml.md), ECCC's data-driven AI weather model, as its spectral nudging target. GEML is also distributed as a standalone 10-day forecast product on the MSC datamart. See [`gdps-geml.md`](./gdps-geml.md) for full documentation of the AI model.
