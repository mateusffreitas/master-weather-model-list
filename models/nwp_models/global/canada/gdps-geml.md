# GEML (Global Environmental eMuLator)

## What this model is
GEML (Global Environmental eMuLator) is Environment and Climate Change Canada's experimental AI-based global deterministic weather forecast model.

It is a graph neural network derived from Google DeepMind's GraphCast architecture (Lam et al., 2023), with weights retrained and refined by ECCC using ERA5 reanalysis (1979–2016) and ECMWF operational analyses (2016–2021). Like other standalone AI weather models, GEML does not solve the equations of fluid dynamics explicitly; instead, it predicts atmospheric evolution directly from learned patterns in historical weather data, producing forecasts orders of magnitude faster than conventional physics-based NWP.

GEML serves two distinct roles operationally. First, it is distributed as its own forecast product through the MSC datamart — a complete 10-day twice-daily global forecast in its own right. Second, it provides the reference large-scale temperature and wind fields that the experimental [GDPS](./gem-global.md) (version 9.0.9) is spectrally nudged toward, making it the AI component of ECCC's hybrid physics-AI forecasting effort.

The current version is GEML 1.0, distributed alongside the experimental GDPS 9.0.9 (implemented March 5, 2025).

## Vertical structure and variables

### Pressure levels (13)
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 850, 925, 1000 hPa

### Prognostic variables
**At pressure levels:**
- Temperature
- Geopotential
- U (zonal) component of wind
- V (meridional) component of wind
- Vertical velocity
- Specific humidity

**At surface:**
- 2 m temperature
- 10 m U component of wind
- 10 m V component of wind
- Mean sea level pressure

---

## What it provides
GEML produces global deterministic forecasts of:
- Temperature (surface and upper-air pressure levels)
- Wind components (10 m and upper-air)
- Geopotential height
- Specific humidity
- Vertical velocity
- Mean sea level pressure

Forecasts are output every 6 hours out to 10 days ahead.

The 13-level pressure grid is identical to the one used by NOAA's GraphCastGFS and AIGFS systems, reflecting the shared GraphCast lineage. This makes GEML, GraphCastGFS, and AIGFS broadly comparable in vertical resolution, though they differ in training data sources, fine-tuning procedures, and operational implementation.

## Relationship to other models

### GEML's two operational roles within ECCC
GEML is unusual in serving as both a standalone forecast product and an internal component of another operational system:

1. **Standalone forecast product:** Distributed at `/today/model_gdps-geml/25km/` on the MSC datamart as a complete 10-day forecast for direct user consumption.
2. **AI component of the operational hybrid GDPS:** GEML's large-scale temperature and wind fields are used as the nudging target for the operational [GDPS](./gem-global.md) (since v10.0.0, May 26, 2026), which spectrally nudges its physics-based GEM forecast toward GEML at large scales (>2750 km) in the mid-troposphere (250–850 hPa).

This dual role distinguishes GEML from other operational AI models like AIGFS or AIFS Single, which serve only as standalone products without being directly used as components of physics-based hybrid systems.

### Architectural lineage
GEML is part of a broader family of operational productionizations of the GraphCast architecture:
- **GraphCast** (Google DeepMind, 2023) — the original research architecture, pre-trained on ERA5
- **[GraphCastGFS](./graphcastgfs.md)** (NOAA, experimental) — NCEP's productionization, fine-tuned on GDAS+ERA5
- **[AIGFS](./aigfs.md)** (NOAA, operational) — operational descendant of GraphCastGFS, replaced EAGLE SOLO in December 2025
- **GEML** (ECCC, this entry) — Canadian productionization, fine-tuned on ERA5 + ECMWF HRES analyses

The four systems share the same underlying GNN architecture and 13-pressure-level vertical structure but differ in training data, fine-tuning procedures, and operational status.

### Architectural peers (different lineages)
- **[AIFS Single](../eu/aifs-single.md)** (ECMWF) — operational AI deterministic, encoder-processor-decoder architecture with attention-based GNN encoder/decoder and sliding-window transformer processor
- **[FourCastNetGFS](./fourcastnetgfs.md)** (NOAA, experimental) — NCEP's productionization of NVIDIA's FourCastNet using Spherical Fourier Neural Operators

### Companion ECCC systems
- **[Operational GDPS](./gem-global.md):** ECCC's stable physics-based global model. Provides the analysis used to initialize GEML.

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2
- **Official download location:**  
  https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/model_gdps-geml/25km/
- **Documentation:**  
  https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/nwp_gdps/readme_gdps-geml-datamart_en/
- **HuggingFace repository (model weights and code):**  
  https://huggingface.co/ECCC-ASTD-MRD/geml

The HuggingFace distribution makes GEML one of the few operational AI weather models whose trained weights are publicly available — a deliberate ECCC choice that contrasts with the more closed weight-distribution practices of some other operational AI systems.

---

## Status
- GEML is distributed as **experimental data** as a component of the experimental GDPS (v9.0.9) ecosystem.
- It is not operationally supported in the same sense as the standard GDPS, GEPS, or other operational ECCC systems.
- The experimental GDPS — and by extension GEML's role as the nudging source — is in pre-operational scientific evaluation as of 2025.
- ECCC's April 2026 supercomputer upgrade to H100 GPU infrastructure is the enabling hardware for routine operational AI inference; GEML inference is GPU-accelerated and was not feasible within ECCC's pre-2026 operational compute envelope.

## Notes
- GEML's 0.25° resolution and 13-level pressure grid match NOAA's GraphCastGFS and AIGFS, reflecting the shared GraphCast architecture. Users comparing the three should be aware that despite this structural similarity, the systems differ in training data (ERA5+HRES for GEML, ERA5+GDAS for the NOAA systems), fine-tuning procedures, and operational status.
- The `/25km/` directory naming on the MSC datamart refers to the approximate metric equivalent of 0.25° resolution at the equator. The actual grid spacing varies with latitude on a regular lat-lon grid, narrowing significantly toward the poles.
- Like other GraphCast-derived models, GEML uses two model states (current time and 6 hours prior) as input to step the forecast forward in 6-hour increments. This means GEML cannot be initialized from a single analysis time — it requires the GDPS analysis at both T and T-6h.
- The 4 surface variables (2 m temperature, 10 m U/V wind, MSLP) and 6 upper-air variables (temperature, geopotential, U/V wind, vertical velocity, specific humidity) constitute the total GEML output set. Variables not in this list — including precipitation, cloud, radiation, and humidity diagnostics commonly available from physics-based NWP — are not produced by GEML directly.
- ECCC's choice to publicly release GEML's weights via HuggingFace (`ECCC-ASTD-MRD/geml`) is operationally meaningful: it allows external researchers and forecast services to reproduce GEML inference, fine-tune the model further, or build downstream products. This contrasts with operational AI weather systems where weights remain proprietary.
- The dual role (standalone product + nudging input for the experimental GDPS) is methodologically distinctive. Most operational AI weather systems are run either as full replacements for physics-based forecasts (AIFS Single alongside IFS, AIGFS as operational complement to GFS) or as research/development products without operational integration. GEML occupies a more closely-coupled position within ECCC's broader hybrid forecasting architecture.
