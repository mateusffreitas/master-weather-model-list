# PE-ARPEGE (Prévision d'Ensemble ARPEGE)

## What this model is
PEARP is the operational global ensemble prediction system run by Météo-France, providing probabilistic medium-range guidance built on the same stretched-grid spectral core as the deterministic [ARPEGE](../../../nwp_models/global/france/arpege-global.md).

It is the ensemble counterpart to ARPEGE: a set of parallel ARPEGE integrations started from perturbed initial conditions whose spread is designed to sample analysis uncertainty, with additional model-error perturbations introduced for longer lead times. The control member is the (interpolated, unperturbed) ARPEGE run itself. Like ARPEGE, PEARP runs on a stretched grid — finest over Western Europe and progressively coarser away from the central point — so a single global integration delivers higher effective resolution over the French and European domains.

In Météo-France's open-data portal the system is branded **PE-ARPEGE** (and **PEARPEGE** in the API documentation and technical PDF filename); **PEARP** is the long-standing operational and scientific name used in the technical descriptions.

- **Country / region:** France

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global, with variable native resolution (highest over Western Europe)
- **Public distribution grids:**
  - **GLOB025** — 0.25° regular lat–lon, global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Global ensemble NWP (stretched-grid spectral)
- **Model system / core:** ARPEGE (shared IFS/ARPEGE code base with ECMWF); SURFEX surface modelling
- **Dynamical formulation:** Hydrostatic, spectral, with semi-Lagrangian advection and semi-implicit time integration
- **Convection-allowing:** No (deep convection parameterized; native ~5 km over Western Europe)
- **Ensemble size:** 35 members (1 control + 34 perturbed)
- **Native horizontal resolution:** Variable — stretched spectral geometry TL1798C2.2, ~5 km over Western Europe, coarsening toward the antipodes
- **Vertical levels:** 105 (from ~10 m to 0.1 hPa)
- **Model top:** ~0.1 hPa (~65 km)
- **Forecast length:** 102 hours (4 days 6 hours), all cycles
- **Update frequency / cycles:** 4× daily (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC)
- **Temporal output resolution:** 1-hourly or 3-hourly depending on domain
- **Time step:** 240 s

## Data assimilation
- **Data assimilation:** No separate PEARP analysis — initial states are derived from the operational ARPEGE analysis and the ARPEGE ensemble of data assimilations (AEARP).
- **Method / cadence:** 35 of the 50 AEARP members are drawn at random and combined with singular-vector perturbations (see below).

---

## Perturbations and design
- **Initial condition perturbations:** Two combined techniques —
  - **Singular vectors** computed at TL95C1 on 65 levels over seven target regions (Europe: 16 vectors; Southern Hemisphere: 10; intertropical band: 28; a complementary Northern Hemisphere domain: 10). Characteristic optimization time is 18 h for Europe/North Atlantic/tropics and 24 h elsewhere. A moist static energy norm is used for the extratropical boxes and a kinetic energy norm for the tropics, where the four tropical boxes shift with the cyclone season.
  - **AEARP ensemble:** 35 of the 50 ARPEGE ensemble-assimilation members, combined with the singular vectors across the seven regions.
- **Model/physics perturbations:** For longer lead times, variability is added by selecting among 10 physics parameterization sets and by perturbing critical parameters of the ARPEGE physics. Two convection schemes are split across the ensemble (17 members each): **PCMT** and **Tiedtke–Bechtold** (the latter matching deterministic ARPEGE). Surface processes use SURFEX with multiple surface types per grid cell, as in the deterministic system.

## What it provides
Probabilistic global forecasts including:
- Individual ensemble member forecasts (1 control + 34 perturbed)
- Surface and upper-air fields: temperature, wind, humidity, pressure, precipitation, cloud cover, and standard diagnostics
- A companion **statistical-fields product** derived from PEARP (ensemble mean, standard deviation, threshold-exceedance probabilities, and anomaly-from-mean) distributed separately over Europe at 0.1° in GRIB2, daily, at ranges 12–84 h (06 UTC run) and 12–96 h (18 UTC run)

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes (Etalab Open Licence)
- **License:** Etalab Open Licence (attribution required)
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2 (GeoTIFF also available via the WCS service)
- **Access:** Météo-France public API portal only (targeted/WCS single-field "API Ciblée PE Modèles"). Unlike deterministic ARPEGE, PEARP is **not** mirrored on `object.data.gouv.fr` bulk storage or the community AWS mirror.
  - **Authentication:** Free API key required. Register at https://portail-api.meteofrance.fr
  - **Access granularity:** 1 model / 1 member / 1 run / 1 step / 1 level / 1 parameter per WCS request (single 2-D lat–lon field; no aggregation)
  - **Retention:** Rolling 5-day window (real-time only; no archive)

## Notes
- **Deterministic counterpart:** PEARP is the ensemble version of [ARPEGE](../../../nwp_models/global/france/arpege-global.md), sharing the stretched-grid spectral core, SURFEX surface scheme, and the ARPEGE physics. ARPEGE (interpolated, unperturbed) is PEARP's control member.
- **Regional sibling:** [PEAROME](../../regional/france/pearome.md), the convection-permitting AROME ensemble over Western Europe, is coupled to PEARP for its lateral boundary conditions.
- **Stretched grid:** As with ARPEGE, the published 0.25°/0.1° grids interpolate a model running at finer native resolution over Western Europe; the regridded resolution does not reflect where the integration is actually finest.
- **Access model differs from ARPEGE:** PEARP is distributed through the WCS-based ensemble API with a 5-day rolling retention and per-member/per-field granularity, rather than the bulk GRIB "Paquets" packages and unauthenticated data.gouv.fr / AWS channels used for deterministic ARPEGE. Users wanting whole-field or whole-member bulk pulls should plan around the single-field WCS access pattern.
- **2022 upgrade (chaîne 2021-01, 29 June 2022):** Resolution aligned with ARPEGE (7.5 → 5 km over Europe); ARPEGE became the PEARP control member; model-error representation revised (perturbed physics parameters + addition of the PCMT convection scheme); new GLOB025 global grid for 3-D fields; all four cycles unified to 102 h.
