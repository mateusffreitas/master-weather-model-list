# AQM (Air Quality Model — NAQFC Ozone and PM2.5 Forecast)

## What this model is
The Air Quality Model (AQM) is the primary atmospheric chemistry component of NOAA/NWS's National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC). It produces operational forecasts of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the United States, and is the system whose output feeds directly into the EPA's AirNow air quality alerts.

AQM is one of three component prediction systems making up NAQFC — alongside [RAP](../../../nwp_models/regional/usa/rap.md) (operational smoke forecasts) and [HYSPLIT-Dust](./hysplit-dust.md) (operational dust forecasts). For the broader NAQFC programme context and how the three components fit together, see the [NAQFC umbrella entry](./naqfc.md).

The current operational version is **AQMv7**, which became operational on 14 May 2024. AQMv7 is a major architectural shift from earlier versions: it transitioned from an offline-coupled GFS-CMAQ chain to a fully online-coupled UFS-based atmosphere-chemistry system embedding CMAQ v5.2.1 within the UFS framework. The earlier offline-coupled architecture (NAM-CMAQ in v5, GFS-CMAQ in v6) is no longer in operational use.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** National Weather Service (NWS) and NOAA, with modeling centres at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) / Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) and the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (ARL)
- **Country / region:** United States
- **Programme:** Component of the National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), a joint NOAA-EPA programme

---

## What area it covers
Since AQMv7 (May 2024), AQM forecasts are run over a **single unified North American domain at 13 km** native resolution, with output regridded to three user-facing product grids:

- **CONUS:** ~5 km grid spacing
- **Alaska:** ~6 km grid spacing
- **Hawaii:** ~2.5 km grid spacing

Earlier versions (AQMv5 and AQMv6) ran three separate domains at ~12 km. The unified-domain design improves consistency at domain boundaries and simplifies long-range transport between regions.

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic atmospheric chemistry forecast (online-coupled atmosphere-chemistry, UFS-based)
- **Core model:** CMAQ v5.2.1 (Community Multiscale Air Quality) embedded within UFS
- **Native horizontal resolution:** 13 km unified North American domain
- **Product grid resolutions:** ~5 km (CONUS), ~6 km (AK), ~2.5 km (HI)
- **Vertical levels:** 65
- **Model top:** 0.2 hPa (raised from 60 hPa in earlier versions)
- **Forecast length:** 72 hours
- **Update frequency:** 2× daily (06, 12 UTC)
- **Temporal output resolution:** Hourly
- **Output units:** O3 in ppb; PM2.5 in µg/m³

### Output averaging
To align with U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards, AQM provides:
- **Ozone:** 1-hour and 8-hour backward-calculated averages, plus preceding 1-hour and 8-hour maximum values
- **PM2.5:** 1-hour and 24-hour averages, plus 24-hour maximum values
- **Bias-corrected versions:** All O3 and PM2.5 fields are also available as bias-corrected outputs, using the Kalman Filter Analog (KFAN) technique trained against AirNow observational data

## Meteorological coupling

### Since 14 May 2024 (AQMv7)
AQM is now a **UFS-based online-coupled atmosphere-chemistry system** — meteorology and chemistry are computed together within the same forecast. The core model components are derived from the community Unified Forecast System (UFS) and from the EPA's CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) model, version 5.2.1, embedded within the UFS framework.

### Prior to 14 May 2024
AQM used an offline-coupled system where a weather model generated meteorological fields that were then passed into CMAQ:
- **20 July 2021 – 14 May 2024 (AQMv6):** GFS v16 meteorology driving CMAQ v5.3.1 (via the NOAA-EPA Atmosphere–Chemistry Coupler, NACC)
- **Before 20 July 2021 (AQMv5 and earlier):** NAM meteorology driving CMAQ

The transition from offline GFS-CMAQ to online UFS-CMAQ in AQMv7 is the single biggest architectural change in NAQFC history.

## Chemistry and aerosols
- **Chemistry model:** CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) v5.2.1 embedded within UFS
- **Gas-phase mechanism:** CB05 (Carbon Bond 05)
- **Aerosol scheme:** aero6 (sectional, 155 species including size distribution Aitken/accumulation/coarse modes)
- **Heterogeneous chemistry:** Including N2O5 hydrolysis with temperature and humidity dependence
- **Inorganic partitioning:** ISORROPIA

---

## Emissions

### AQMv7 (current)
- **Anthropogenic:** EPA National Emissions Inventory (NEI) data
- **Biogenic:** MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature), replacing the older BEIS system used in earlier versions
- **Soil NOx:** Included during springtime (March, April, May)
- **Wildfire:** RAVE (Regional ABI and VIIRS Emissions) data at 0.03° resolution, hourly — replacing daily GBBEPx inputs used in AQMv6. Updated to RAVE v2.0 with NOAA-21 satellite data on 1 October 2024.
- **Fugitive dust:** ARL Fengsha wind-blown dust emission model
- **Point sources:** NEI point source data projected to the current year using DOE projection factors

---

## Data assimilation
AQM itself does not assimilate air quality observations directly. However, the **Kalman Filter Analog (KFAN) bias correction system** uses AirNow observations to correct raw model predictions:
- Applied post-forecast to O3 and PM2.5 outputs
- Trains on historical model forecasts matched to observations at AirNow surface monitoring sites
- Uses NOx, NOy, and O3 as parameters to identify analogs for O3
- Since AQMv7 (May 2024), KFAN is applied over the large unified North American domain with an expanded AirNow observation set

The driving meteorological component (formerly GFS, now UFS) has its own independent data assimilation cycle.

---

## What it provides
- **Surface-level concentrations:**
  - O3 (hourly, 1h and 8h averages, 1h and 8h maxima — raw and bias-corrected)
  - PM2.5 (hourly, 1h and 24h averages, 24h maximum — raw and bias-corrected)
- **Supplemental meteorology:** Surface fields consistent with the driving NWP component

For wildfire smoke and dust, AQM does not produce these as primary forecasts — they come from the other NAQFC component models. See the [NAQFC umbrella entry](./naqfc.md) for the full picture.

### Earlier history
NAQFC's operational history dates to 2004, initially with a Northeast U.S. forecast domain. The CONUS domain became operational in September 2007; Alaska and Hawaii domains were added later. Across this multi-decade development, AQM has consistently been the ozone and PM2.5 component of the broader capability.

## Notes
- The AWS archive spans multiple AQM versions (v5, v6, v7) with different physics, driving models, and domains. Users conducting long-term studies should be aware of the transitions, particularly the major AQMv6 → AQMv7 shift in May 2024 (offline → online coupling, separate → unified domain, vertical-level expansion).
- AQM's outputs feed directly into the **AirNow** air quality index system and the EPA-NOAA joint air quality forecasting program. Public-facing AQI alerts in the U.S. are based in part on AQM guidance.
- AQM does **not** produce smoke or dust forecasts — those are produced by [RAP](../../../nwp_models/regional/usa/rap.md) and [HYSPLIT-Dust](./hysplit-dust.md) respectively, also under the NAQFC umbrella.
