# INCA (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis)

## What this model is
INCA (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis) is GeoSphere Austria's operational analysis and nowcasting system for the near-surface atmosphere. It blends surface station observations, radar, satellite, an NWP first guess, and high-resolution terrain data into a 1 km gridded analysis of the current state, then extrapolates and blends that analysis into the NWP forecast to produce short-range forecasts (nowcasts) of temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity.

INCA was specifically designed for complex mountainous terrain (the eastern Alps), using a valley-floor vertical coordinate and a terrain-aware "surface-layer index" so that observations are interpreted appropriately for valley-floor, slope, and ridge locations. It is used for flood warning and forecasting and underpins GeoSphere's spatially detailed weather web portals.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** GeoSphere Austria (formerly ZAMG — Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik; merged into GeoSphere Austria in 2023)
- **Country / region:** Austria

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Austria and the surrounding eastern Alpine region
- **Domain details:** The Austrian operational INCA domain covers roughly 600 km × 350 km centred on the eastern Alps, on a 1 km grid. The public products use the MGI / Austria Lambert projection (EPSG:31287); the nowcast bounding box is approximately 45.5–49.48 °N, 8.1–17.74 °E (the hourly analysis product spans a slightly wider 45.77–49.48 °N, 7.1–17.74 °E).

## Basic details
- **System type:** Nowcasting
- **Nowcasting method:** Seamless extrapolation–NWP blend, built on a comprehensive multi-source analysis. The analysis combines an NWP first guess with station, radar, and satellite data; nowcasts extrapolate the analysis and merge into the NWP forecast across the lead-time window.
- **Technique / algorithm:** For precipitation and cloudiness, Lagrangian persistence (classical advection with motion vectors from cross-correlation of consecutive analyses). For temperature, humidity, and wind, an Eulerian nowcast that applies the NWP model trend on top of the latest analysis. Terrain handling uses a valley-floor reference surface, a nondimensional surface-layer index, inverse-distance-squared interpolation in physical and potential-temperature space, and elevation-dependent precipitation combining rain gauges with radar.
- **Underlying / driving model:** The NWP first guess and trend are provided by GeoSphere's operational [AROME Austria](../../../nwp_models/regional/austria/arome-austria.md) (AROME-Aut). The foundational INCA papers (2011) describe the then-operational driver as ALADIN-Austria (9.6 km, 60 levels, 4× daily to +72 h); GeoSphere has since transitioned its operational limited-area model from ALADIN to AROME.
- **Probabilistic / ensemble:** No (deterministic)
- **Horizontal resolution:** 1 km
- **Vertical structure:** The public products are 2D near-surface fields (2 m temperature and humidity, 10 m wind, precipitation). Internally the analysis is three-dimensional, using a z-coordinate measured above a slowly varying valley-floor surface (temperature analysis on 21 levels at Δz = 200 m to ~4000 m above the valley floor; wind analysis on 32 levels at Δz = 125 m).
- **Lead time:** 0–3 h (public nowcast product). Internally the nowcast blends into the NWP forecast over a longer window, and INCA continues to add value to the NWP forecast through downscaling at longer ranges.
- **Update frequency:** Every 15 minutes (nowcast product). The companion analysis product updates hourly.
- **Temporal output resolution:** 15-minute steps (nowcast); 1-hour (analysis)
- **Latency:** Not documented (TBD)

## Inputs
- **NWP fields:** First-guess and trend fields from AROME Austria (historically ALADIN-Austria). 3D temperature, humidity, and wind plus 2 m / 10 m surface fields, precipitation, cloudiness, and ground temperature are used.
- **Radar:** The Austrian radar composite (C-band radars operated by Austro Control, the civil aviation authority), supplemented with data from neighbouring countries; the maximum constant-altitude plan position indicator (max-CAPPI) product is the main radar input. (The 2011 papers describe a four-radar composite, with a fifth radar then being added.)
- **Satellite:** Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) NWC-SAF cloud-type product plus the visible (VIS) image, at a 15-minute time step, used for the cloudiness analysis and nowcast.
- **Surface / other observations:** GeoSphere's network of ~250 TAWES semi-automated weather stations (average spacing ~18 km, spanning ~100–3800 m elevation), plus ~100 hydrometeorological stations. Observed quantities include 2 m temperature, relative humidity, dewpoint, 10 m wind, precipitation amount, and sunshine duration.
- **Terrain:** A high-resolution 1 km digital elevation model and derived fields (valley-floor surface, surface-layer index).

## Blending / seamless transition
For precipitation and cloudiness, the observation-based extrapolation receives full weight over roughly the first 2 hours and is then weighted down linearly to zero by about 6 hours, where the NWP forecast takes over. For temperature, humidity, and wind, the NWP trend is blended with the analysis over a stability-dependent timescale (about 3 hours in well-mixed conditions, up to ~12 hours under strong inversions). Beyond the nowcasting range, INCA continues to improve the NWP temperature forecast through terrain downscaling. The publicly distributed nowcast is capped at a +3 h horizon.

## What it provides
The public 15-minute nowcast product provides 0–3 h forecasts of:
- 2 m temperature
- Precipitation
- 10 m wind
- 2 m humidity

The fuller INCA system additionally analyses and nowcasts cloudiness, global radiation, precipitation type (rain / snow / sleet / freezing rain), snowfall line, and ground temperature, and derives convective parameters (e.g. CAPE, CIN, LCL); not all of these appear in the public 15-minute nowcast dataset.

## Notes
- **Two related public products, one system.** The nowcast product (`nowcast-v1-15min-1km`) is the short-range forecast (+3 h, 15-minute updates) and is the subject of this entry. The analysis product (`inca-v1-1h-1km`) is the comprehensive analysis half of INCA — hourly gridded fields with an archive back to March 2011, useful for verification, downscaling, and reanalysis-style applications. It is analysis rather than forecast data, but shares the same system, grid, license, and API.
- **Relationship to the NWP suite:** INCA sits downstream of GeoSphere's NWP models, using [AROME Austria](../../../nwp_models/regional/austria/arome-austria.md) as its first guess and trend source; the [C-LAEF](../../../ensemble_models/regional/austria/c-laef.md) ensemble and AROME-RUC rapid-update system are separate products in the same operational suite.
- **INCA family:** INCA was developed at ZAMG and has been adopted beyond Austria (the EU "INCA-CE" Central European initiative; a Swiss configuration, INCA-CH, uses COSMO as its first guess). Several INCA domains exist across central Europe. Empirical coefficients in the analysis are tuned to the NWP first guess and may need recalibration for a different driving model.
- **Documented skill (eastern Alps):** Per the validation papers, the INCA temperature analysis has an MAE around 1 °C (larger, ~1.5–2.5 °C, in deep Alpine valleys where inversion height is uncertain), with humidity MAE/RMSE around 5 %/7 % and 10 m wind-speed MAE around 0.5–0.8 m s⁻¹. Nowcasts add value over the raw NWP forecast mainly in the first 2–3 h for precipitation and the first ~6 h for temperature. Independent verification against the high-density WegenerNet station network confirmed the analysis skill without evidence of overfitting.
- **Organizational note:** GeoSphere Austria was formed by the 2023 merger of ZAMG with the Geological Survey of Austria; older publications and documentation refer to ZAMG.
